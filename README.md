# Haptic Material Dataset and Kinematic-motivated Haptic Material Classification Network
An official implementation of the paper _Learning Based Surface Material Classification utilizing Haptic Data Modeled with Kinematic Modalities_, including the HapMat datasets as well as the HapNet along with related files. The paper will be made available as soon as it is accepted (if possible) by IEEE IROS 2023.
