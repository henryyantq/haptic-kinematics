**The paper is now accepted by IEEE CASE 2023!** The open-access version of the paper can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1221HU043OiFagdT_EtBUv9MBsV-KjA7t/view?usp=sharing). **Feel free to clone our full project, test, and even make improvements on your own.** We also STRONGLY suggest you utilize our given datasets for any testing purpose, especially making it much easier for you to try our pretrained model.

### Abstract
Abstractâ€” The advancement of modern robotic systems is inseparable from the development of artificial sensory modules and functions that provide robots with human-like perception. Among these, haptic sensation is of vital importance for robot interaction with the environment. Many research works have been conducted in the past decades to enable robots to sense the environment, especially in the area of surface material classification. This paper offers a learning-based low-cost but high computational efficient method adopting multiple kinematic modalities, namely the haptic-kinematic data. We introduce a haptic surface material dataset and propose a kinematics-motivated haptic surface material classification network (HapNet) trained and tested on our dataset. The results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of a purely kinematic haptic scheme without the need for other perceptual modalities.

### How to run our codes
The core of our project, HapNet, is written and trained in TensorFlow 2. Please follow the instructions below for users of different operating systems. These codes are recommended to be run on GPU-available devices, but notice that they are also made efficient to be deployed on **CPU-only** devices!

#### 1. For Mac users
If you are a Mac user, please follow the [official document by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/) to install the GPU-enabled version of TensorFlow. You can skip this for a CPU-only implementation.

#### 2. For Windows/Linux users
If you require an **Nvidia** GPU-accelerated implementation, install the Nvidia Driver and CUDA first before you ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. If you wish to run the codes with GPUs from other brands, e.g. AMD, Intel, please follow [the official document by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/gpu-tensorflow-plugin) to deploy TensorFlow for DirectML, **which has NOT yet been examined by us**.
