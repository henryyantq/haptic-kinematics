### Abstract
Abstractâ€” The advancement of modern robotic systems is inseparable from the development of artificial sensory modules and functions that provide robots with human-like perception. Among these, haptic sensation is of vital importance for robot interaction with the environment. Many research works have been conducted in the past decades to enable robots to sense the environment, especially in the area of surface material classification. This paper offers a learning-based low-cost but high computational efficient method adopting multiple kinematic modalities, namely the haptic-kinematic data. We introduce a haptic surface material dataset and propose a kinematics-motivated haptic surface material classification network (HapNet) trained and tested on our dataset. The results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of a purely kinematic haptic scheme without the need for other perceptual modalities.
